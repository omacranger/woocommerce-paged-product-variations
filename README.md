# Paged Product Variations for WooCommerce [DEPRECATED]
Paged Product Variations for WooCommerce is a project committed to making large storefronts using WooCommerce manageable by having the variations in the back-end paginated.

The plugin is designed for WooCommerce 2.3.x, however, has backwards-compatibility with < 2.3.x versions.

**WooCommerce 2.4.x now included paginated variations in the back-end, and as such, this plugin has been deprecated. The plugin can still be downloaded via the WordPress repository, but is no longer needed for up-to-date versions of WooCommerce. I'm glad to see it baked in by default, it has been a much needed feature.**

## Example
The below is an example of what the plugin looks like in action. The default setting (which can be changed via a filter) is 10 variations per page.

## Installation
Navigate over to the [WordPress Plugin Page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/paged-product-variations/) and install it on your site.

Alternatively, you can grab a zip of the repository and drop it in your 'plugins' folder inside WordPress to have a work in progress build.

## TODO
1. Input field to go to a specific page.
2. Better layout for systems with a _large_ number of variations (thousands)
3. Ability to search through variations by SKU (including SKU pattern)
4. Possibly a setting to change the number per page - currently this can be done via a filter
